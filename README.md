# Business Website
### I designed a business website for a fictional furniture and chair company. The website features a home page, products page, and a where to buy page where information about dealers is listed.
## ***Demo:*** https://business-website-doganeraylin.vercel.app

## Project Highlights
- created the website using Nuxt 3, SASS, JavaScript, and the JSON Server package for creating a mock API.
- animated the sections using GSAP to enhance the visual experience.
- users can browse through the collection and click on individual products to view more details.
- users can filter dealers based on their country for easier navigation.
- adopted a mobile-first approach and implemented a responsive design to ensure seamless user experience across different devices.
- with ChatGPT's assistance, I curated engaging narratives and descriptions.
